# Lab 2: Architecture Design and API Planning

### Objective

In this lab, you will design the architecture of a full-stack application and plan the API endpoints that will be implemented in the backend. You will create system diagrams and document the API contracts.

# Tasks

## 1. Architecture Design

Create a Use Case Diagram to represent how users interact with the system.

Draw a Class Diagram to define the key entities and their relationships.

Design a System Architecture Diagram that illustrates:

Flutter frontend

Spring Boot backend

Database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL)

API communication between frontend and backend



## 2. API Planning

Identify the required REST API endpoints based on the user stories from Lab 1.

Document each endpoint with the following details:

HTTP Method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

Endpoint URL

Request Parameters (Query Params, Path Variables, or Body)

Response Format (Success & Error Responses)


Use Swagger (OpenAPI) or Postman to document the API contract.


# Deliverables

## 1. Diagrams:

Use Case Diagram

Class Diagram

System Architecture Diagram



## 2. API Documentation:

API contract with details of each endpoint

Optional: Swagger/OpenAPI JSON/YAML file



# Examples:

## Use case diagram

```mermaid

    User((User)) -->|Places Order| App
    Courier((Courier)) -->|Manages Order| App
    Owner((Restaurant Owner)) -->|Manages Order| App

    User -->|Makes Payment| Payment
    Owner -->|Receives Payment| Payment
    
    User -->|Receives Delivery| Delivery
    Courier -->|Delivers Order| Delivery
    Admin -->|Manages Delivery| Delivery
    
    subgraph App
        Order(Place Order)
        Payment(Payment)
        Delivery(Object Delivery)
    end
```
